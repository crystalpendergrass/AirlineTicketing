# AirlineTicketing

Detailed documentation can be found in FinalProject_PendergrassC.docx.

The airline registration program allows the user to select a flight and enter personal details and ticket holder details.  This information is added to a MS Access database.  The user can also search for a ticket holder and view the ticket holder details.  The user can also delete a ticket holder, freeing the ticket holder's seat

From a window the user should select flight details and enter name and contact information and the names and seat selection for each ticket.  In a second window the user can search for a ticket and choose to delete that user.
